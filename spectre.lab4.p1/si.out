Notice from spectre during IC analysis, during transient analysis `tran1'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is
        recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

DC simulation time: CPU = 1.061 ms, elapsed = 1.06287 ms.

Notice from spectre during transient analysis `tran1'.

Maximum value achieved for any signal of each quantity: 
V: V(/net19) = 5.154 V
I: I(V0:p) = 6.736 mA
If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different
        in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage
        control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option
        `bin_relref=yes'.
